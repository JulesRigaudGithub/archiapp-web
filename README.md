## Links to replit tutorial
All questions about TP 1 and 2 are answered in replit but the code is quite messy and unorganized :

- [TP1 : front](https://replit.com/@julesrigaud200/MockUp)
- [TP2 : back](https://replit.com/@julesrigaud200/MessageBoard)

The zip archives are available on this repo under the archive folder as well. The API in this repo is only meant for the messaging service.
