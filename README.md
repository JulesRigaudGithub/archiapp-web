Simple messaging app for Benoit Valiron's web course at CentraleSupélec by Grégoire Desjonquères and Jules Rigaud

## Links to replit tutorial
All questions about TP 1 and 2 are answered in replit but the code is quite messy and unorganized :

- [TP1 : front](https://replit.com/@julesrigaud200/MockUp)
- [TP2 : back](https://replit.com/@julesrigaud200/MessageBoard)

The zip archives are available on this repo under the archive folder as well. The API in this repo is only meant for the messaging service.

## Link to render app

The deployement is feasible with render blueprints, which is Infrastructure as Code. All the requirements for the static webfront and Node microservice are written in the yaml file.
